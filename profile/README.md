# Curriculum AI

This organization is used to manage Curriculum-AI microservices.

## Technologies

For this application we will use:

- Node JS (Back-End);
- React JS (Front-End);
- AWS (Cloud Services);

## Dev. Requirements

For this organization's repositories we have some code standards that we need to follow, they are listed below:

- ALL commits must follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standards, if not followed your PR will be automatically closed;
- The _main_ branch is used for deployments, so to commit changes on it you are going to need to open a pull request;
